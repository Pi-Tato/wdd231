        <h2>Choose Your Game Engine</h2>
        <p>There are a lot of game engines to choose from. Here are some of the most popular ones:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Unity</li>
            <li>Unreal Engine</li>
            <li>Godot</li>
            <li>Construct 3</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each engine has its own advantages and disadvantages, so it's important to choose the one that best suits your needs. For this guide, we'll be using Unity.</p>
        <h2>Getting Started with Unity</h2>
        <p>Before you can start coding, you need to install Unity. You can download it from the Unity's website. <a href="https://unity.com/download" target="_blank">unity.com/download</a></p>
        <h2>Creating a New Project</h2>
        <p>Once you have Unity installed, you can create a new project. Open the Unity Hub and click the "New Project" button on top right.</p>
        <img src="images/Step 1.png" alt="Step 1">
        <p>Under "Project Name", enter a name for your game. Then under "Project Location", enter a location for your project. The "Unity Organization" will be your username.</p>
        <p>There are a lot of Render Pipelines, but we will be using the Universal 3D Render Pipeline (URP). Then click "Create project" on the bottom right.</p>

        <p>Unity will then create a new project in the location you specified. It will take a few minutes to open your new project initially.</p>
        <p>When your project opens up, you may see errors in the console. This is normal and can be ignored. To fix it, delete "Sample Scene" in the "Scenes" folder. Then make a new scene in the "Scenes" folder, close Unity and open it again. The errors should be gone.</p>

        <h2>Creating a New Scene</h2>
        <p>After you have created a new scene, let's start on Creating a Main Menu!</p>
        <p>Right click on the Hierarchy and click "UI" then click "Panel". Then name it "Main Menu". This will create a "Canvas" with a "Panel" inside of it.</p>
